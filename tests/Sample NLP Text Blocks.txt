Team Lead - Systems Maintenance at CNSC, December 2010 to October 2015. During my tenure at CNSC, I was responsible for all
aspects relating to contracted resources, having at one time more than 12 contracted resources reporting to me. This included the
creation of the TBIPS, the evaluation and results, and as necessary informal discussions on results with unsuccessful companies. In
addition, I have worked closely with the contracting team here at CNSC, to look at opportunities to refine our contracting process, with
improvements being made to the contracting template. I have also been involved in the contract review committee for the
organization, looking for unfair practises and consistency.
An example of my contracting experience, for the ACR project, I was required to hire 4 contracted programmer / analyst. I was
required to provide the statement of work, review the proposals, conduct interview process and document the results. The success of
the ACR project was directly associated to the success of the resources we were able to engage in a short time frame to respond to
the need. This demonstrated my ability to engage quality professional services.


My previous position at Courts administration services (operations manager, 2011-2014); involved providing technical advises and
recommendations on a daily basis, I report to the Director of IT (cs-05) as being involved in 5 initiatives considered to be the
department's Top priority. These initiatives are presented to the DCA (EX3) directly, where I presented plans for these initiatives to the
EXCOM (Executive Committee, EX 01 and above). I worked very closely with the IT Director and DG developing and presenting these
plans. , I presented a DECK to the DCA and EXCOM recommending and advising on the feasibilities of these initiatives/Projects. I
presented my recommendations based on: Client requirements, Scope, Cost, Risk/ restraints, Timelines and PROS/CONS.
I have been involved preparing the necessary business cases negotiating and seeking additional funding and approval from the DG of
IM/IT and the Executive Committee to provide a more agile and efficient service to our clients especially with IT technology and trends
being the focal point while the departmental budgets are decreasing.
Example of 2 Recommendations:
1. In 2012 , while working at CAS I recommended presented to the DG of IT the replacement a presentation on of all Network
switches with more adequate, efficient and futuristic switches (layer 3 switches) that will help CAS monitor traffic / flows as well as
adding advanced functionalities such as advanced monitoring of flow, traffic and QOS( quality of services). This project was approved
and implemented in 2012.
2. In 2013 in my current job as Infrastructure and operations manager, I presented recommendations to IT Director General to
implement BES 10 server, the BES 5.0 server that currently manages the current Blackberry devices will eventually be out of support
with the new platform availability as well the provider will cease selling devices that are supported by this management tool. Based on
that I presented my recommendations/presentation (including the criteria listed above) to implement this new platform. (Project
approved and in pilot mode to be fully operation in the production environment by February 2014)
Note: many more are available upon request such as BYOD (Bring your own device) as part of the IT/ Telecom Trends/Initiatives,
Axios Assyst and more.
