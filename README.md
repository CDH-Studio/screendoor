ScreenDoor is open-source software for use by hiring managers in the Government of Canada, built by
[CDH-Studio](https://cdhstudio.ca) co-op students. It assists users to review large numbers of
applications received in PDF format and uses Natural Language Processing to extract highlights from
users' written responses to application questions.

For usage and more information, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/CDH-Studio/screendoor/wiki).
